# C- binary tree data structures.


The goal is to start thinking about: 

 how binary treees will the tertiary layer in our brains, can store and delete. But most importantly Search. 
 Binary trees can be very helpful. 
 This program makes me think of controls in binary tree stored. 
 
 * Questions: 
   + how would we want to use the computer in our brains? 
   + should the interaction with our limbic system be automatic, only revisable after the user puts in a code? 
   + Do we want to be preview of what the neuralink tertiary layer i doing on all times? 
   + Should the controls be in a binary tree of level of control?
